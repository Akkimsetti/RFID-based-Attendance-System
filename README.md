# RFID-based-Attendance-System

"RFID based Attendance system" is a project emphasis on RFID (Radio Frequency Identification). This RFID system enables us to log the student attendance with ease.

When the student identification card (RFID card) is swiped over an RFID reader, the system identifies the student based on unique UID number and updates his/her details in a Google Sheet which can be used as daily report for attendance. Besides, it pushes a notification to student's mail regarding status of attendance. This makes the a lot of difference from traditional attendance. The report gives the count of total number of student who has attended the class.
